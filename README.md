# what is the PoliX4 project?
This is the result of the joint work of four students aiming to create a dynamic instruments which ensures the user maximum freedom in the creation of rhytmic and melodic patterns. Each rhythmic structure is represented by a keyboard whose scale and tonality can be indipendently (and also jointly) programmed. Up to 3 instruments (2 synths and 1 drum set) can be selected and played within a single keyboard and the number of keys can be choosen by the user. Besides, the number of bars can be increased up to 4 for all layers.
