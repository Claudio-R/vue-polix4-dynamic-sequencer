# What is the PoliX4 project?
This is the result of the joint work of four students aiming to create a dynamic instruments which ensures the user maximum freedom in the creation of rhytmic and melodic patterns. Each rhythmic structure is represented by a keyboard whose scale and tonality can be indipendently (and also jointly) programmed. Up to 3 instruments (2 synths and 1 drum set) can be selected and played within each keyboard and the number of keys can be choosen by the user. 
Last but not least, tempo, octave and number of bars can be increased up to 4 for all layers.

# How was it developed?
Such a complex system put us in front of several difficulties which would not have been easily overcome without the help of such a powerful tool as Vue.js.
Vue is a JavaScript framework enabling frontend developers to create amazing users interfaces through a declarative and component-based programming model. 
Its core feature is the declarative rendering of HTML custom and reactive components, whose output is based on JavaScript state. State changes for each component are tracked and used to efficiently update the elements in the DOM.

# Innovative GUI
The most captivating part of PoliX4 is its fully responsive design which makes it playable on any device and screen size.
This responsive interface was made thanks to the Vuetify framework, a Vue UI Library providing developers with a huge collection of Material Components and tools for designing their application.
